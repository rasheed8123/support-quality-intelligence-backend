Thank you for reaching out regarding your refund request.

I understand you're requesting a refund for the Advanced Python Course you purchased last month. According to our refund policy, we offer full refunds within 30 days of purchase if you haven't completed more than 25% of the course content.

I've checked your account and can see that you've completed only 15% of the course materials, so you're eligible for a full refund of $299.

The refund will be processed within 3-5 business days and will appear on your original payment method. You'll receive a confirmation email once the refund has been initiated.

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Hassan
Support Team""",
